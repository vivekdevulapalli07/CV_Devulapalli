\begin{justify}
{I am an early-career postdoctoral researcher specializing in advanced electron microscopy with a materials science background. I employ aberration-corrected STEM to link atomic structure and composition to material properties across multiple length scales. My expertise includes multidimensional imaging, analytical techniques, STEM simulations, and correlative approaches for comprehensive material characterization. \\

\par
During my PhD, I investigated the atomic-scale structure of grain boundaries in titanium, which led to high-impact publications. During my first postdoc at MPIE, I studied hydrogen embrittlement in additively manufactured alloys. In my second postdoc at EMPA, I focused on deformation mechanisms in structural and functional materials, including single crystals, additively manufactured alloys, and multilayered crystalline/amorphous materials. I am deeply committed to open science and science communication.}
