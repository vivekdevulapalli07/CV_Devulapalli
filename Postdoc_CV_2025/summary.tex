\begin{justify}
{I am an early-career postdoctoral researcher specializing in advanced electron microscopy with a materials science background. I employ aberration-corrected STEM to link atomic structure and composition to material properties across multiple length scales. My expertise includes multidimensional imaging, analytical techniques, STEM simulations, and correlative approaches for comprehensive material characterization. \\

\par
My PhD work on grain boundary engineering in titanium, including the discovery of segregation-induced phase transitions, culminated in a Science publication (2024). As a postdoc at MPIE, I expanded into hydrogen embrittlement mechanisms in particle-reinforced high-entropy alloys, combining advanced characterization with mechanical testing. Currently at EMPA, I employ in-situ S/TEM techniques to investigate deformation mechanisms across diverse material systems, from single crystals to complex multilayered architectures. Beyond research, I am committed to open science practices and active science communication.}
